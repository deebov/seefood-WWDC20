# SeeFood WWDC20
SeeFood app from Silicon Valley that detects if it is a hotdog or not hotdog

I added a little surprise feature. It also detects if the taken photo contains human faces, if yes then it displays a hotdog mask on their face

I use SquezeNet model for hotdog recognition. And Apple's Vision framework for face detection
